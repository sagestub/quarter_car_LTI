function varargout = clf_line_joint_plates(varargin)
% CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES MATLAB code for clf_line_joint_plates.fig
%      CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES, by itself, creates a new CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES returns the handle to a new CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES('Property','Value',...) creates a new CLF_LINE_JOINT_PLATES or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before clf_line_joint_plates_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to clf_line_joint_plates_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
