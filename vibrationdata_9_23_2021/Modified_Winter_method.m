function varargout = Modified_Winter_method(varargin)
% MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD MATLAB code for Modified_Winter_method.fig
%      MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD, by itself, creates a new MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD returns the handle to a new MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD('Property','Value',...) creates a new MODIFIED_WINTER_METHOD or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Modified_Winter_method_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Modified_Winter_method_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
